# <h1 align="center">üïπÔ∏è Game for GAS IR</h1>
This app is designed for newly hired Data Entry Specialists, specifically
Image Reviewers (IR), at Global Agility Solutions (GAS). As a former IR at GAS, I
conceived the idea of creating an application intended to assist new IRs in memorizing
the abbreviations, nicknames, and license plates of specific US states.

Disclaimer: I was not paid by GAS to build this project. This is a self-initiated project.
